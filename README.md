OpenCV Camera Calibration

`camera_calibration.py` follows the tutorial and performs calibration on a chessboard pattern. 

Input images from [Camera-Calibration-Python](https://github.com/DavidWangWood/Camera-Calibration-Python) are stored in `calibration_wide` and corner detected images are stored in `calibration_wide_results`. 

`calibration.py` follows the exercise instructions and performs calibration on an ACS research skill stamp pattern. 

Test input images taken with an iPhone X rear camera are stored in `calibration`, contour detected images are stored in `contour`, corner detected images are stored in `calibration_results`, and undistorted images are stored in `calibration_undist`.

Input images that have observable tangential distortion are stored in `calibration_tangential`, corner detected images are stored in `calibration_tangential_results`, and undistorted images are stored in `calibration_tangential_undist`.
